# Auto-Zoomer

This hastily written chrome extension will automatically set webpages to a predefined zoom factor if the tab is on a "higher" (>1920x1080) res display. It is mainly written for Vivaldi, not Chrome and there are things that might not fit or work for other chrome browsers.

There are some very obvious bugs, feel free to improve.
